# QR-Code-
In this Python code uses the qrcode library to generate a QR code that encodes a specific URL.
I have imports the qrcode library, which is a Python library for generating QR codes.
The parameters version, box_size, and border are used to configure the QR code generation:
-version: Specifies the size of the QR code (1 in this case).
-box_size: Specifies the size of each box or "module" in the QR code.
-border: Specifies the size of the border around the QR code.

This code creates a QR code for the specified URL using the qrcode library, customizes its appearance, and saves the generated QR code as an image file.
